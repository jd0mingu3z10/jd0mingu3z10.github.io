				<li>Web<ul>
				<li>Runs over the internet</li>

				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>The web is a series of interactions between 2 types of systems, clients and servers.</li>
				<li>Clients<ul>
				<li>Devices that render web content.</li>
				<li>Popular clients include browsers, mobile applications, screen readers, and various content aggregators.<h2 id="working-with-clients-and-servers">Working with clients and servers</h2>
				</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>When your domain makes a request, it uses the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to locate the requested content. This request is usually passed on to a domain name server or DNS. The DNS then translates the URL into an IP address. The browser then uses this IP address to locate the host&#39;s server and send a request for the content.</li>
				<li>Dynamics site pages must first be processed by a web application such as PHP, .NET, or Ruby before that content is served to a browser.<h2 id="the-dns-and-why-it-matters">The DNS and why it matters</h2>
				</li>
				<li>DNS is one of the most important processes on the web and it&#39;s also one of the most overlooked.</li>
				<li>Domain name servers for DNS address one of the fundamental differences between humans and computers.</li>
				<li>The DNS system is an incredibly complex in fluid database this distributed across servers all over the world.</li>
				<li>If your site isn&#39;t registered properly with a DNS, no one will be able to find you.</li>
				<li>Multi-name sites need to point to the proper IP.</li>
				<li>Make sure that you are aware of who site ownership is assigned to.</li>
				<li>DNS caching can take up to 24 hours.<h2 id="internet-protocols">Internet protocols</h2>
				</li>
				<li>Protocols are simple languages that let computers share information with each other.</li>
				<li>The internet uses a group of protocols commonly referred as to &quot;The Internet Protocol Suite&quot;.</li>
				<li>Transmission control protocol Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</li>
				<li>Created in 1973, it has become the main protocol suite used to exchange data over the internet.</li>
				<li>Internet Protocol Suite<ul>
				<li>Application layer: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, RIP, SNMP</li>
				<li>Link layer: Wireless LAN, Ethernet, ATM</li>
				<li>Transport Layer: TCP, UDP</li>

				</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>A web server is nothing more than a computer with a specialized set of software and components.</li>
				<li>All web servers are assigned an IP address, and the sites that they host are registered through a domain name server so that requests for it&#39;s pages can be found.</li>
				<li>Web stacks are groups of software that work in conjunction with each other to help build and process websites.</li>
